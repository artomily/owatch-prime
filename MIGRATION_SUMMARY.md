# üîÑ Migration Summary: Solana ‚Üí HashPack (Hedera)

## ‚úÖ Changes Completed

### 1. **Core Wallet Integration**
- ‚úÖ Replaced Solana wallet adapter with HashConnect/HashPack
- ‚úÖ Updated `src/context/WalletContext.tsx` with Hedera wallet logic
- ‚úÖ Modified `src/components/WalletProvider.tsx` to re-export new context
- ‚úÖ Created new `src/components/WalletButton.tsx` (HashPack-aware)

### 2. **Component Updates**
The following components were updated to use `useWalletContext()` instead of Solana's `useWallet()`:

- ‚úÖ `src/components/WalletButton.tsx` (new implementation)
- ‚úÖ `src/components/SidebarWalletInfo.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `src/components/landing/LandingPage.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `src/components/landing/LandingNavbar.tsx`

  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom`
  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`
  - `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`
  - `@solana/web3.js`
- ‚úÖ Ran `npm install` to clean up node_modules

### 4. **Type Definitions**
- ‚úÖ Updated `src/types/index.ts`: `WalletProvider` type now includes `'hashpack' | 'hashconnect' | 'dummy'`

### 5. **Documentation**
- ‚úÖ Created `HASHCONNECT_SETUP.md` with setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Created this migration summary

## üéØ How the New Wallet Flow Works

### Development Mode (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`)
1. Checks if `@hashgraph/hashconnect` is installed
2. If yes: attempts to initialize HashConnect pairing flow
3. If no (or pairing fails): falls back to a **mock development wallet** with random address

### Production Mode (`NODE_ENV !== 'development'`)
1. Detects if **HashPack browser extension** is installed
2. If yes: connects via HashPack extension API
3. If no: shows **"Continue with dummy wallet"** button + link to install HashPack

### Dummy Wallet Fallback
- Users without HashPack in production can click "Continue with dummy wallet"
- Generates a random address prefixed with `dummy:`
- Allows testing the app without real wallet connection

---

## üì¶ Optional: Install HashConnect for Development

The app works without `@hashgraph/hashconnect`, but if you want to test the full HashConnect pairing flow in development:

```bash
npm install @hashgraph/hashconnect
```

**Note:** This is completely optional. The app gracefully falls back to mock wallets if the library is not found.

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Development with HashConnect:**
  - Install `@hashgraph/hashconnect`
  - Run `npm run dev`
  - Click "Connect Wallet"
  - Verify HashConnect pairing flow works

- [ ] **Development without HashConnect:**
  - Ensure `@hashgraph/hashconnect` is NOT installed
  - Run `npm run dev`
  - Click "Connect Wallet"
  - Verify a mock dev wallet is created

- [ ] **Production with HashPack:**
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Install HashPack extension: https://hashpack.app/
  - Visit production site
  - Click "Connect with HashPack"
  - Verify extension pairing works

- [ ] **Production without HashPack:**
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Visit production site (without HashPack extension)
  - Verify "Continue with dummy wallet" button appears
  - Click it and verify dummy wallet is created
  - Verify "Install HashPack" link is present

---

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test wallet connection** in your browser

3. **(Optional) Install HashConnect for dev testing:**
   ```bash
   npm install @hashgraph/hashconnect
   ```

4. **Production deployment:**
   - Build: `npm run build`
   - Deploy as usual
   - Users can use HashPack or dummy wallet

## üìö Resources

- **HashPack Wallet:** https://hashpack.app/
- **HashPack Docs:** https://docs.hashpack.app/
- **HashConnect Docs:** https://docs.hashconnect.hashpack.app/
- **Hedera Network:** https://hedera.com/

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- TypeScript errors may appear if `@hashgraph/hashconnect` is not installed (expected)
- The wallet context uses dynamic imports and `@ts-ignore` comments to handle optional HashConnect
- Mock/dummy wallets are for testing only and don't interact with real blockchain

---

## üéâ Migration Complete!

Your app now uses **HashPack** (Hedera) instead of Solana. All Solana dependencies have been removed, and the wallet integration supports both development (HashConnect) and production (HashPack extension + dummy fallback).
