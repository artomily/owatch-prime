# 🎉 Solana → HashPack Migration Complete!

Your O'Watch application has been successfully migrated from **Solana** to **HashPack (Hedera)**.

## 📋 What Changed

✅ **All Solana dependencies removed** from `package.json`  
✅ **Wallet integration switched** to HashConnect/HashPack  
✅ **Smart fallbacks** for development and production  
✅ **All components updated** to use new wallet context  

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Wallet Connection

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and click **"Connect Wallet"**

**In Development Mode:**
- If you have `@hashgraph/hashconnect` installed → HashConnect pairing flow
- Otherwise → Mock development wallet with random address

**In Production Mode:**
- If HashPack extension is installed → Connects via HashPack
- Otherwise → Shows "Continue with dummy wallet" button

### 3. (Optional) Install HashConnect for Full Dev Testing

```bash
npm install @hashgraph/hashconnect
```

This enables the full HashConnect pairing flow in development. **Not required** – the app works fine without it using mock wallets.

## 📚 Documentation

- **Migration Summary:** See [`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`](./MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md) for detailed changes
- **HashConnect Setup:** See [`HASHCONNECT_SETUP.md`](./HASHCONNECT_SETUP.md) for configuration guide

## 🔍 Key Files Changed

### Core Wallet Logic
- `src/context/WalletContext.tsx` - Main wallet provider with HashConnect/HashPack integration
- `src/components/WalletButton.tsx` - New wallet connection button
- `src/components/WalletProvider.tsx` - Thin wrapper re-exporting context

### Updated Components
- `src/components/SidebarWalletInfo.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/LandingPage.tsx`
- `src/components/landing/LandingNavbar.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/VideoContent.tsx`

### Configuration
- `package.json` - Solana dependencies removed
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated `WalletProvider` type

## 🧪 Testing

### Development (Mock Wallet)
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Click "Connect Wallet" → Mock dev wallet created
```

### Development (HashConnect)
```bash
npm install @hashgraph/hashconnect
npm run dev
# Click "Connect Wallet" → HashConnect pairing flow
```

### Production (HashPack)
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Install HashPack: https://hashpack.app/
# Click "Connect with HashPack" → Extension pairing
```

### Production (No HashPack)
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Without HashPack extension installed
# Click "Continue with dummy wallet" → Test mode
```

## ⚠️ TypeScript Warnings

You may see these TypeScript warnings (they're expected and won't prevent the app from running):

- ❌ `Cannot find module '@hashgraph/hashconnect'` → Expected if library is not installed (optional)
- ❌ `Cannot find module 'react'` → Common in Next.js, resolves at runtime
- ❌ `Cannot find name 'process'` → Install `@types/node` if needed: `npm i -D @types/node`

The app uses dynamic imports and `@ts-ignore` comments to handle the optional HashConnect library gracefully.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `npm run dev` to test the app
2. ✅ Try connecting with the wallet button
3. ✅ (Optional) Install `@hashgraph/hashconnect` for full dev testing
4. ✅ Deploy to production when ready
